# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
In the evolving landscape of the financial sector, the development and application of machine learning algorithms for the detection of fraudulent transactions has become a focal point of interest. This project is aligned with that very objective. Utilizing a dataset encompassing approximately 28,500 credit card transactions, we aim to employ multiple unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms to identify transactions with a heightened likelihood of being fraudulent.

The machine learning algorithms that will be constructed and implemented in this project are as follows:

Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
Isolation Forest Algorithm
Moreover, we will leverage metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-scores to scrutinize the potential misleading nature of classification accuracy within these algorithms.

To further enhance our understanding of the data set’s underlying distribution, we will delve into data visualization techniques commonly employed in data science. These include, but are not limited to, parameter histograms and correlation matrices.

We look forward to embarking on this journey of exploration and discovery in the realm of machine learning and fraud detection. Let’s commence our endeavor.
